## 🚀 Overview

**RiskIQ** is an enterprise-grade, multi-agent AI platform designed to automate financial compliance analysis, document intelligence, and decision support workflows.  

The system transforms complex agreements and structured datasets into actionable insights through autonomous agents, regulatory knowledge integration, and real-time analytics.

RiskIQ demonstrates how modern AI architectures can enhance operational efficiency, improve decision accuracy, and support regulatory readiness for financial institutions such as NBFCs, fintech platforms, and banking organizations.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Financial institutions face increasing regulatory complexity, manual document processing challenges, and fragmented decision workflows, leading to inefficiencies, operational risks, and delayed insights.

RiskIQ addresses this by providing an autonomous AI system capable of analyzing documents, evaluating data, monitoring conditions, and generating intelligent reports within a unified platform.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

RiskIQ is built on a modular **multi-agent orchestration architecture**, where specialized AI components collaborate to execute complex workflows.

## � Core Intelligence: The Astra Swarm

- **Nexus Core (Orchestrator)**  
  Central coordination engine responsible for workflow routing, agent communication, and execution sequencing.

- **OmniExtract (Document Intelligence Agent)**  
  AI-powered parsing and semantic extraction engine that converts unstructured documents into structured insights.

- **Astra Compliance (Regulatory Agent)**  
  Evaluates extracted data against regulatory and governance rules to compute compliance indicators.

- **Sentinel Risk (Inference Agent)**  
  Performs anomaly detection, threshold monitoring, and machine-learning-based fraud probability scoring.

- **Lexis Report (Reporting Agent)**  
  Generates high-fidelity summaries and downloadable executive PDF reports with deterministic fallbacks.

- **Atlas Vault (Data Layer)**  
  Hybrid storage architecture supporting structured telemetry (Postgres) and deep-extraction storage (MongoDB).
